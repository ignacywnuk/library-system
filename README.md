Please write a simple library management system
User Interface must be based on bootstrap
There is one special (existing) user 'librarian'
An ordinary user must log in to his account, if he does not have an account, he can create one in the account registration process (without email confirmation)
A logged in user who does not have borrowed books can delete his account (librarian cannot delete the account)
The list of books in the library is permanent (books can only be borrowed and returned) and is read from the program data
The user can search for books.
If the book is not borrowed or reserved, the user can reserve it.
The reservation is valid until the end of the next day
The user can view his reservations and delete some (indicated).
The librarian user can view a list of all bookings and change the found booking to a rental
The librarian user can view a list of all rentals and change the information that the book is available in the found loan
Data should be persisted using *.json files on the server (A Student may use database on the server instead)
